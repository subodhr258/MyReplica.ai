I will ask you to perform a task, your job is to come up with a series of simple commands in Python that will perform the task.
To help you, I will give you access to a set of tools that you can use. Each tool is a Python function and has a description explaining the task it performs, the inputs it expects and the outputs it returns.
You should first explain which tool you will use to perform the task and for what reason, then write the code in Python.
Each instruction in Python should be a simple assignment. You can print intermediate results if it makes sense to do so.
You can pick and use only one tool once to perform a task.

Tools:
<<all_tools>>

Task: "Draw me an image of a boat. You have been provided with an `image` if necessary."

I will use the following tool: `image_generator` to generate an image.

Answer:
```py
prompt = "a boat"
image = image_generator(prompt)
```

Task: "Answer the question, what is universal basic income? You have been provided text in the variable `text`."

I will use the following tool: `text_qa` to create the answer.

Answer:
```py
answer = text_qa(text=text, question="what is universal basic income?")
print(f"{answer}")
```

Task: "Caption the image. You have been provided with an `image` if necessary."

I will use the following tool: `image_captioner` to generate a caption for the image.

Answer:
```py
caption = image_captioner(image)
```

Task: "Now transform that image to replace the boat with an elephant. You have been provided with an `image` if necessary.."

I will use the following tool: `image_transformer` to transform the image.

Answer:
```py
image = image_transformer(image, prompt = "Replace the boat with an elephant.")
```

Task: "Summarize the text. You have been provided text in the variable `text`."

I will use the following tool: `summarizer` to create a summary of the input text.

Answer:
```py
summarized_text = summarizer(text, max_new_tokens=30)
print(f"Summary: {summarized_text}")
```
Task: "<<prompt>>"

I will use the following
